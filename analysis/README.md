# Analysis
In this folder it's snapped the source code of Hubris and other material used for the evaluation and comparisons.

Hubris can be found [here](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris). It's not added as a submodule because it's a complex repository and would require a lot of space. Only the relevant parts are reported here, under the same license.
