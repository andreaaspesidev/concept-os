//! Provides fake atomic read-modify-write operations for situations where you
//! _really_ know what you're doing.
//!
//! Pulling this trait in can cause code written for ARMv7-M and later machines,
//! which have atomic read-modify-write operations, to compile on ARMv6-M. This
//! is, in general, not safe: the program wanted an atomic read-modify-write and
//! you're faking it with a non-atomic sequence. However, in our _specific_ case
//! on Hubris, we can do this safely because
//!
//! 1. Tasks are isolated.
//! 2. Tasks are single-threaded.
//! 3. ISRs do not access memory shared with tasks.
//!
//! If any of those three points is wrong in your case, do not use these, it
//! will go badly for you.
//!
//! Everything in this crate is conditional on the `armv6m` config, which means
//! (1) it will only work inside the Hubris build system and (2) accidentally
//! including it on armv7m or later won't pull in the bogus implementations.
//!
//! # Why not just disable interrupts
//!
//! Because (1) we can't from unprivileged mode and (2) we don't out of
//! principle anyway.
