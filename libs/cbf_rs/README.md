# CBF RS
This `no-std` library enables a component/application to read an CBF binary.
No allocation support required, very little memory consumption.

See `examples/readcbf.rs` for an example of usage.

## Credits
This library is based on the `no-std` ELF library [elf_rs](https://lib.rs/crates/elf_rs)
